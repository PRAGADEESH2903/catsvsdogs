I am excited to share my Cat vs. Dog Image Classification Model code! 🐱🐶 This model uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to correctly classify photos of cats and dogs. Let's go into the code sample together and work on its development! I am grateful to Bharat Intern for providing me with this crucial chance for progress.
